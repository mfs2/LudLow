# Ludlow
 This 3D presentation of Ludlow, Vermont. Ludlow is a ski town with a large enterprise on the West mountain.
 The town of Ludlow is in the valley and the river corridors are shown in yellow. 
 E911 points are used to show points that are mostly businesses or dwellings.
 Ludlow was badly damaged in the recent flooding and the reason is easy to see.
 Overdevelopment on the mountain sides and unusually heavy rain made flooding unavoidable.
